# S3-Portfolio
Portfolio en documentatie voor mijn semester 3 van Fontys HBO-ICT

# Learning outcome 1. Web application
**Learning outcome:** You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications.

**Clarification:**

**User friendly:** You apply basic User experience testing and development techniques.

**Full-stack:** You design and build a full stack application using commonly accepted front end (Javascript-based framework) and back end techniques (e.g. Object Relational Mapping) choosing and implementing relevant communication protocols and addressing asynchronous communication issues.

Om deze leeruitkomst aan te kunnen tonen heb ik een ontwerp gemaakt van de applicatie die ik wil gaan bouwen. Zie https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation.md#C4-model voor het C4 model, wat ik voor deze mijn applicatie heb gemaakt.

De verschillende componenten van mijn software kunnen los van elkaar worden ontwikkeld end getest. Verder wil ik ervoor zorgen dat ieder component zijn eigen Docker container is.

Front-end

Mijn keuzes over de front-end kunnen gevonden worden onder https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation.md#Front-end-development

Mijn keuze voor het framework React.js wordt meer uitgelegd onder https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation.md#Keuze-front-end

Back-end

Mijn uitleg over mijn keuze van de back-end kun je vinden onder https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation.md#Back-end-development

Mijn keuze over mijn ORM en het databehoud kan onder https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/S3-Portfolio/blob/main/Documentation.md#Data-behoud worden gevonden.

De back-end code kan gevonden worden op <https://github.com/KevinvdHoogenhof/novelsite-backend> 


# Learning outcome 2. Software quality 
**Learning outcome:** You use software **tooling and methodology** that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.

**Clarification:**

**Tooling and methodology:** Carry out, monitor and report on unit integration, regression and system tests, with attention for security and performance aspects, as well as applying static code analysis and code reviews.


# Learning outcome 3. Agile method
**Learning outcome:** You **choose** and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.

**Clarification:**

**Choose:** You are aware of the most popular agile methods and their underlying agile principles. Your choice of a method is motivated and based on well-defined selection criteria and context analyses.
# Learning outcome 4. CI/CD
**Learning outcome:** You **design and implement** a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.

**Clarification:**

**Design and implement:** You design a release process and implement a continuous integration and deployment solution (using e.g. Gitlab CI and Docker).


# Learning outcome 5. Cultural differences and ethics
**Learning outcome:** You **recognize** and **take into account** cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.

**Clarification:**

**Recognize:**  Recognition is based on theoretically substantiated awareness of cultural differences and ethical aspects in software engineering.

**Take into account:**

Adapt your communication, working, and behaviour styles to reflect project stakeholders from different cultures;

Address one of the standard Programming Ethical Guidelines (e.g., ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct) in your work.  


# Learning outcome 6. Requirements and Design
**Learning outcome**: You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using **multiple types of test techniques.**

**Clarification:**

**Multiple types of test techniques:** You apply user acceptance testing and stakeholder feedback to validate the quality of the requirements. You evaluate the quality of the design (e.g., by testing or prototyping) taking into account the formulated quality properties like security and performance.


# Learning outcome 7. Business processes
**Learning outcome:** You analyze and describe **simple** business processes that are **related** to your project.

**Clarification:**

**Simple:** Involving stakeholders, predominantly sequential processes with one or two alternative paths.

**Related:** Business processes during which the software that you are developing will be used (business processes that the software must support by fully or partially automating them). 

or

Business processes needed for the success of your software development project (e.g., product release, market release, financial assurance).
# Learning outcome 8. Professional
**Learning outcome:** You act in a **professional manner** during software development and learning.

**Clarification:**

**Professional manner:**

You actively ask and apply feedback from stakeholders and advise them on the most optimal technical and design (architectural) solutions.

You choose and substantiate solutions for a given problem.
